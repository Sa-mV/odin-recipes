            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Swedish Meatballs, known as "k√∂ttbullar" in Sweden, are a delicious and comforting dish that combines tender, juicy meatballs with a creamy, rich gravy. The meatballs are made from a blend of ground beef and pork, which gives them a perfect balance of flavor and texture. Key ingredients like finely chopped onion, breadcrumbs soaked in milk, and a blend of seasonings including allspice and nutmeg, are mixed into the meat to add depth and a hint of warmth. Once formed into small, bite-sized balls, they are browned to perfection in a skillet. The gravy is a highlight of the dish, made in the same pan to incorporate the flavors left by the meatballs. It typically includes beef broth, heavy cream, and a touch of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce for a savory depth, thickened with a roux and seasoned to taste. The meatballs are simmered in this gravy until they're cooked through and infused with its rich flavor. Served traditionally with lingonberry jam, creamy mashed potatoes, or buttery egg noodles, Swedish Meatballs offer a delectable blend of savory and slightly sweet flavors, making them a beloved dish in Swedish cuisine and beyond.
