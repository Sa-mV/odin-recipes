            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Lasagna, a classic Italian dish, is a sumptuous and hearty meal perfect for family gatherings or a cozy dinner. The recipe starts with the preparation of a rich meat sauce, where ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork) is browned and simmered with onions, garlic, and a blend of Italian herbs, such as basil and oregano, in a tomato-based sauce. This is layered with sheets of lasagna noodles, which can be pre-cooked or oven-ready, alternating with generous scoops of the meat sauce. Between these layers, a creamy mixture of ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, and grated Parmesan adds a velvety texture, while slices of mozzarella cheese provide a gooey, stretchy element. The lasagna is assembled in a deep baking dish, starting and ending with a layer of meat sauce, ensuring the noodles are completely covered. Sprinkled with extra Parmesan and mozzarella on top, the dish is baked in the oven until it's bubbling and the cheese is golden brown, resulting in a rich, layered delight with a perfect balance of meat, cheese, and pasta.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ground beef - 1 pound</li>
                    <li>Onion - 1 large, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>Garlic - 2 to 3 cloves, minced</li>
                    <li>Canned tomatoes - 1 large can</li>
                    <li>Tomato paste - 1 small can</li>
                    <li>Italian seasoning (basil, oregano, thyme) - 2 teaspoons</li>
                    <li>Salt - to taste</li>
                    <li>Black pepper - to taste</li>
                    <li>Lasagna noodles - about 12 sheets (either pre-cooked or oven-ready)</li>
                    <li>Ricotta cheese - 1 and 1/2 cups</li>
                    <li>Eggs - 2, beaten</li>
                    <li>Grated Parmesan cheese - 1 cup</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella cheese - 16 ounces, sliced or shredded</li>
                    <li>Olive oil - for cooking the meat and onions</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the Sauce: To the meat, add the canned tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Cook the Noodles (if not using oven-ready): If you're using traditional lasagna noodles, cook them according to the package instructions until they are just al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a deep baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then a layer of mozzarella slices, and then a layer of meat sauce. Repeat these layers (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce) until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
                    <li>Add Final Cheese Topping: Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan and mozzarella cheese over the top layer of the meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Bake the Lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Rest Before Serving: Once removed from the oven, let the lasagna rest for about 10-15 minutes. This allows it to set and makes it easier to cut into servings.</li>
                    <li>Serve and Enjoy: Cut the lasagna into squares and serve. It pairs wonderfully with a side salad and crusty bread.</li>
