        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna, a classic Italian dish, is a sumptuous and hearty meal perfect for family gatherings or a cozy dinner. The recipe starts with the preparation of a rich meat sauce, where ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork) is browned and simmered with onions, garlic, and a blend of Italian herbs, such as basil and oregano, in a tomato-based sauce. This is layered with sheets of lasagna noodles, which can be pre-cooked or oven-ready, alternating with generous scoops of the meat sauce. Between these layers, a creamy mixture of ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, and grated Parmesan adds a velvety texture, while slices of mozzarella cheese provide a gooey, stretchy element. The lasagna is assembled in a deep baking dish, starting and ending with a layer of meat sauce, ensuring the noodles are completely covered. Sprinkled with extra Parmesan and mozzarella on top, the dish is baked in the oven until it's bubbling and the cheese is golden brown, resulting in a rich, layered delight with a perfect balance of meat, cheese, and pasta.</p>
